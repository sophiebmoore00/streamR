# streamR

Spotify users can request a year's worth of personal data from Spotify, with information on their streaming history, playlists, search history, and more. 

streamR is an R package designed to work with these data files and make it easier for users to analyze and visualize their personal data. 

This is a collaborative project created for STAT 431.
